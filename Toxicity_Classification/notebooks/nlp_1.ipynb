The web site (http://www.usdoj.gov) included copies of press releases, speeches and other publicly available information.\\nThe security breach \"is just like graffiti on the outside of the building,\" spokesman Bert Brandenburg said.\\nOther organisations have been targeted in the past. Last year, the Nation of Islam\\'s Million Man March web site was vandalised. And hackers make 250,000 attempts annually to break into U.S. military computers, according to a General Accounting Office report.\\nWindows Magazine recently found security flaws at web sites of a dozen major corporations. \"The web is spectacularly insecure,\" editor Mike Elgan said. Relying on security holes that had been documented by software manufacturers months earlier, the magazine\\'s specialists were able to gain various degrees of unauthorised access at the different sites.\\nElgan said hackers who are exploiting some of the same flaws are motivated by anger over the growth and commercialization of the Internet. \"A common theme is that hackers are fed up with non-hackers on the Internet,\" he said.\\nThe battle is not completely hopeless. \"You can secure a web site,\" Richard Power said. \"There\\'s all kinds of measures you can take. Most corporations and institutions don\\'t take them simply because nothing bad has happened to them yet.\"\\nSome sites are using multiple layers of security, well beyond simple password protection, to keep hackers out.\\nOne site mentioned by Windows Magazine was Fidelity Investments. Fidelity\\'s site advertises its mutual funds and disseminates information about personal finance but does not contain confidential customer information.\\nFidelity officials immediately closed the loophole identified by the magazine, a spokeswoman said. But multiple security measures previously in place would have prevented a security breach despite the hole, the spokeswoman added.\\n'"

       "'The Internet may be overflowing with new technology but crime in cyberspace is still of the old-fashioned variety. The National Consumers League said Wednesday that the most popular scam on the Internet was the pyramid scheme, in which early investors in a bogus fund are paid off with deposits of later investors. The league, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, tracks web scams through a site it set up on the world wide web in February called Internet Fraud Watch at http://www.fraud.org. The site, which collects reports directly from consumers, has been widely praised by law enforcement agencies. \"Consumers who suspect a scam on the Internet have critical information,\" said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission\\'s Bureau of Consumer Protection. Internet Fraud Watch \"has been a major help to the FTC in identifying particular scams in their infancy.\" In May, for example, the commission used Internet reports to shut down a site run by Fortuna Alliance that had taken in over $6 million, promising investors they could earn $5,000 a month from an initial deposit of $250. Instead, Fortuna kept most of the money, the commission charged. Fraud reports from the league\\'s site, which has been visited over 370,000 times, are forwarded to local, state and federal authorities. The second-most-popular Internet scam, the league said, was the sale of bogus Internet services, such as custom designed web sites or Internet access accounts. In third place were crooks who sell computer equipment, such as memory chips or sound boards, over the net and then deliver significantly lower quality goods or nothing at all, the league said. Other top scams involve business opportunities. Con artists may offer shares in a business or franchise using unreasonable predictions or misrepresentations. One popular scheme promised to let consumers get rich while working at home. The League also announced Tuesday that NationsBank had donated $100,000 to become a sponsor of the Fraud Watch site. '"

       "'Compaq Computer Corp., the world\\'s largest personal computer maker, will launch its first computer workstations this week with low-cost entrants that already have at least one workstation maker scrambling. \"They have a fighting chance to really threaten some of the traditional vendors,\" said Keren Seymour, an analyst with International Data Corp., a market research firm. On Tuesday Compaq will unveil three systems in the \"personal workstation\" area, the faster-growing segment of the $15.1 billion market for workstations -- high-powered computers used by engineers and designers to perform complex calculations requiring enormous power. Traditional workstations run on the UNIX operating system and the market has been dominated by Sun Microsystems Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. But in the past two years, Microsoft Corp\\'s Windows NT operating system has been making major inroads and a host of companies now develop lower-cost workstations running NT. According to IDC, the personal workstation market -- workstations selling at prices from $4,500 to $10,000 -- is growing at a faster pace than traditional, UNIX-based arena, where systems cost from $17,000 up to $100,000. While Windows NT cannot yet handle some of the memory-intensive, highly technical applications, Seymour said, NT-based workstations are widely used for financial modeling, animation, and computer-aided design. Engineers can also run their desktop applications, such as spreadsheets, word processing, and electronic mail, on the same system, instead of having two separate computer systems. \"It\\'s growing at an average rate of 44 percent a year,\" Seymour said of the personal workstation area, compared with traditional workstation growth of 7.5 percent, on a compounded annual growth rate, through the year 2000. Already, Houston-based Compaq\\'s expected entry in the market has at least one major vendor nervous. Last week, IBM held a hastily-arranged conference call for analysts to discuss the formation of a new business unit that will develop Intel-based workstations running NT. \"It was an answer to Compaq\\'s initiative,\" said Sam Albert, an industry consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y. Otherwise, he asked, \"Why would IBM give a heads up for a product that isn\\'t ready until March?\" IBM\\'s current line of workstations, the RS/6000 family, are designed around IBM\\'s PowerPC chip and run on the UNIX operating system. In its third-quarter earnings report, however, IBM said its workstation business was flat, another indicator of the increasingly popularity of the lower-cost NT-based machines. Compaq is expected to introduce three models in the $5,000 to $10,000 range, IDC\\'s Seymour said. A Compaq spokeswoman declined to comment on the products to be unveiled Tuesday. PC Week, an industry trade magazine, reported last week that Compaq will price its entry-level workstation at $5,000, targeted to molecular modeling and computer-aided design. Two other models, for the animation creation business, are priced from $8,000 to $10,000, PC Week said. As part of its recent product revamp, Silicon Graphics Inc., long a leader in the animiation workstation area, also recently introduced a less-expensive model called the O2, which runs on UNIX, in response to the growth in the NT-based machines. But analysts said SGI and Sun Micro will not likely embrace the Microsoft operating system NT anytime soon, even though it is poised to become the faster-growing workstation segment. \"Sun and SGI would rather die than do NT,\" said Seymour. \"That\\'s the unfortunate thing ... At some point, the NT market share is going to be bigger than theirs.\" '"
